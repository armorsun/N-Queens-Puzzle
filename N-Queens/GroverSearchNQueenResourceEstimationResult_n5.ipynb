Its value must be between 0 and 1 and the default value is 0.001, which corresponds to 0.1%, and means that the algorithm is allowed to fail once in 1000 executions.  This parameter is highly application specific. For example, if one is running Shor's algorithm for factoring integers, a large value for the error budget may be tolerated as one can check that the output are indeed the prime factors of the input.  On the other hand, a much smaller error budget may be needed for an algorithm solving a problem with a solution which cannot be efficiently verified.
